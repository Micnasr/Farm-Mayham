# Farm Mayham :man_farmer:	

I am a huge fan of the overcooked franchise where you need to work in a team in order to deliver the food to the customers in time.
<p>I made my own farming version where you and your friend need to work in harmony in order to deliver the crops to the customers! :people_holding_hands:	</p> 

At the top you are given which crops the customers are ordering and it is your job to:
* plow the ground :recycle:	
* plant the seeds :farmer:
* water the plants :potable_water:	
* deliver them while making sure that the vegetables do NOT spoil! :x:	

<p>3D Modeling and Programming was done by me using the Unity3D engine and Blender.</p>
